        <h1> Welcome to Club Jiu Jitsu!</h1>
        <p>Before we talk about ourselves, 
            there is a probability that you don't know what Jiu Jitsu is, 
            so before we talk about ourselves, let us introduce you to the sports of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</p>

        <h2> What is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu?</h2>
        <p> is a self-defence martial art and combat sport based on grappling, ground fighting (ne-waza) and submission holds. BJJ focuses on the skill of taking an opponent to the ground, controlling one's opponent, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks or chokeholds.
            Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was first developed around 1920s by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., George, and Hélio Gracie, after Carlos was taught traditional Kodokan judo by a travelling Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda in 1917, Later going on to develop their own self-defense system named Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.
